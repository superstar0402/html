        Q: Why do I need to pay an extra 21% (VAT)?<br />
        A: This is just how traditional finances work when selling services to
        individuals - there isn't anything we can do about it.

        Q: What is the included dev project like?<br />
        A: Up to you, really! A few ZK languages will be introduced, their pros
        and cons explained, some possible project ideas presented and then it's
        up to you. No rating or reviews will be done for the project.
