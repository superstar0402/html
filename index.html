      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        There are no hard prerequisites for the course. However, since this is a
        developer course, you get a lot more out of this if you already know
        some development.

      <p>
        If you wish to develop the end project, which is highly recommended, you should at least be comfortable with:

            <li>Finding solutions to your programming issues online</li>
            <li>Using the terminal</li>
