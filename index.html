        </ul>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        There are no hard prerequisites for the course. However, since this is a
        developer course, you get a lot more out of this if you already know
        some development.
      </p>

      If you wish to develop the end project, which is highly recommended, you
      should at least be comfortable with:
      <ul>
        <li>Writing code in some modern language</li>
        <li>Finding solutions to your programming issues online</li>
        <li>Using the terminal</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- <section id="pricing">
